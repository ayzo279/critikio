# Harmonalyze (WIP)
### A music discovery platform. Find similar songs from your favorite artist based on what you're listening to now.

## How to use
<ol>
  <li>
    Go to https://harmonalyze-site.onrender.com.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create an account and navigate to the homepage.
  </li>
  <li>
    Input a reference song and its artist. The algorithm will try to find songs that sound/feel similar to this.
  </li>
  <li>
    Toggle any song features you want the algorithm to highlight. E.g. Do you want something danceable like YMCA or very emotionally painful like Let It Go by James Bay?
    <ul>
      <li>Danceability: Find me songs that get me to dance as easily/hard as the reference song.</li>
      <li>Energy: Find me songs that have the same level of intensity as the reference song.</li>
      <li>Tempo: Find me songs that have similar beats-per-minute as the reference song.</li>
      <li>Emotions: Find me songs that convey the same emotions as the reference song.</li>
      <li>Vocal Presence: Find me songs that have similar ratios of words-to-music as the reference song.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose an artist(s) you want the results to pick from. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Click "Search" and the algorithm will produce 5 songs that are similar to your reference song based on the selected criteria.
  </li>
</ol>

## Features in-development (stay tuned!)
<ul>
  <li> __Exploration history__ Users will be able to save their explorations to a repository accessable from the sidebar for view later.</li>
  <li> __Open discovery__ An alternative button option will be added to allow for free explorations of current hits instead of requiring target artists. Listen to artists you may not have heard from before.</li>
  <li> __Song data analysis__ Compare the features of songs side by side to understand their similarities and differences. Explore the track-by-track, album-by-album feature variations from individual artists.</li>
</ul>
